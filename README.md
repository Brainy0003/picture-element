# This repo is obsolete
The canonical repository is the [WHATWG HTML repository](https://github.com/whatwg/html).

## Purpose
This repository contains the history for a subset of the [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
covering most of the [Embedded content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#embedded-content) section,
including the `picture`, `source` and `img` elements.
The history of earlier proposals for the `picture` element, before it was adopted in the HTML specification, is also in this repository.
