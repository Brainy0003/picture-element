# The ```<picture>``` Element
This is repository for a subset of the [HTML Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/)
covering most of the [Embedded content](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content.html#embedded-content) section,
including the `picture`, `source` and `img` elements.

## Found a bug?
If you found a problem with the document, no matter how small,
please [file a bug](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/issues).

Proposals for normative changes to the specification should take
place on the [RICG mailing list](mailto:public-respimg@w3.org)
or [WHATWG mailing list](mailto:whatwg@whatwg.org).
