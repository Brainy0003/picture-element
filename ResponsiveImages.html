		<p>Through the introduction of a  <code>picture</code> element, this specification adds functionality to HTML that allows authors to list a range of images which may be suitable for a range of device capabilities and different usage scenarios. The ability to adapt content to the constraints and capabilities of devices and different usage scenarios is commonly referred to as &quot;responsive design&quot;.
	This allows user agents to be more responsive to a wide spectrum of  browsing scenarios, ranging from simple mobile devices to desktop browsers scenarios, when selecting which image resources to download and display for an end-user. This includes, but is not limited to, the selection of images best suited for either high or low density displays and screen resolutions on range of devices, are well as responsive selection of images based on  printer's dpi and color reproduction capabilities.</p>

    <p>The <code><dfn>picture</dfn></code> element used for displaying an image that can come from a range of sources.</p>
  <p>The image given by the src attributes is the embedded content; the value of the alt attribute provides equivalent content for those who cannot process images or who have image loading disabled. </p>
  <p>For user agents that don't support picture, an author can provide an img element as fallback content. User agents SHOULD NOT show this content to the user: it is intended for Web browsers which do not support <code>picture</code>, so that a legacy  <code>img</code> element can be shown.</p>
	<p>The picture element must not be used as a layout tool. In particular, picture elements should not be used to display transparent images, as they rarely convey meaning and rarely add anything useful to the document.    </p>

    <p>The <dfn id="attr-picture-width"><code>width</code></dfn> attribute and the <dfn id="attr-picture-height"><code>height</code></dfn> attributes   give the dimensions of the visual content of the element (the width and height respectively, relative to the nominal direction of the output medium), in CSS pixels.

	  <p>Unlike the <code>picture</code> element, the <code>img</code> element is limited to a single image resoure, but  cases where an author need to define different image sources depending on the factors such as the design, size resolution, and display density. The most suitable image source may be an image sized appropriately for the display size or pixel density. Or the most suitable image source may be a different version of an image that has been modified by the author to be suitable for a particular use (see: <a>art direction</a> use case)</p>

		<h1>Algorithms</h1>
	  <p>Editorial note: goals for the algorithm</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The appropriate asset MUST be fetched by way of a single request, initially. A change in window size causing the media attribute to match an alternate source SHOULD trigger a request for said source (to be retrieved from the browser cache, if possible).</li>
		  <li>To address potential bandwidth concerns, the user agent SHOULD be able to override requests for higher-resolution images based on proposed user settings, for example: “always request high-resolution images,” “always request low-resolution images,” and “request high-resolution images as bandwidth permits” based on the bandwidth information available to the browser.</li>
		  <li>User agents that do not natively support the <code>picture</code> element will render the <a>fallback content</a> (including any child <code>img</code> element) per the behavior of existing HTML5 media elements.</li>
      </ul>
		
		<p>The basic algorithm for processing the <a><code>picture</code> element</a> is as follows:</p>

		<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
			<li>Evaluate <code>media</code>/<code>src</code>/<code>srcset</code> attributes on the parent <a><code>picture</code> element</a> first.
				<div class="note">See <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Jun/0116.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Jun/0116.html</a></div>
				<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
					<li>If the <code>media</code> attribute on the <code>picture</code> element should match, evaluate <code>srcset</code> ( per the <a>image-set notation</a> algorithm ) or the <code>src</code> attribute.</li>
					<li>If not, continue to step two below.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Evaluate <code>source</code> child elements per the <a>resource selection algorithm</a> already defined for the <code>media</code> attribute to select the appropriate source element.</li>
			<li>Once the <code>source</code> element has been identified, look to see if the element has <code>srcset</code> defined. If <code>srcset</code> exists, follow the the <a>image-set notation</a> algorithm. If <code>src</code> is specified on the <code>source</code> element, let that be the chosen <code>picture</code> source.</li>
			<li>The user agent will ignore any <code>img</code> elements that are children of the <code>picture</code> element.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="issue">It should be possible to determine from script which source was selected. For media elements, this is done with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/media-elements.html#dom-media-currentsrc"><code>currentSrc</code> IDL attribute.</a></div>

<!-- /fallback-behavior -->

	<section id="accessibility">
	  <h1>Accessibility</h1>
		<p>The <code>picture</code> element relies on fallback content as representative alternate text, rather than calling for an <code>alt</code> attribute on both the parent <code>picture</code> element and the fallback <code>img</code>. This provides a method for specifying short alternative text without requiring authors to specify an identical attribute on both <code>picture</code> and the fallback <code>img</code>, with the potential to reach the greatest number of end users without requiring a redundant effort on the part of authors.</p>
		
		The <code>alt</code> attribute MUST be handled according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-alt-techniques/#secm1">techniques for providing useful text alternatives for <code>img</code> elements</a> no different from <code>alt</code> attributes on <code>img</code> elements outside of the <code>picture</code> context.</p>
		<p>The <code>alt</code> attribute is NOT permissible on <code>source</code> elements. If the alternate text description of a <code>source</code> element differs from other <code>source</code> elements, it would suggest that the listed sources are not different versions of the same image, but are likely to be different images entirely.</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>The eventual resolution of <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/30">ISSUE-30: Should HTML 5 include a longdesc attribute for images</a> will determine the method by which authors can provide semantically rich markup as accessible text.</p>

			<h1>Goals</h1>
		  <p>This proposal was designed with the following goals in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Respond to different screen pixel width/height.</li>
				<li>Respond to different screen pixel densities.</li>
				<li>Respond to user zoom on image resource.</li>
				<li>Provide user agents with information they need to select the most appropriate image source given low bandwidth situations.</li>
				<li>Will fallback gracefully on older user agents.</li>
				<li>Can be polyfilled effectively.</li>
				<li>Retains, at a minimum, the same level of accessibility as current <code>img</code> element.</li>
				<li>Preserves separation of content markup and styling.</li>
				<li>Provides a purely client-side solution which can include JavaScript, but doesn’t require it.</li>
				<li>Supports use cases where authors need to explicitly define different image versions as opposed to simply different resolutions of the same image.</li>
				<li>Provides a consistent and predictable pattern for delivering alternate media sources based on client context.</li>
				<li>Supports succinct but understandable mark-up.		        </li>
				<li>Don't repeat yourself: If the same image is used multiple times on a single page, it would be useful to define the resource selection in a single place in the document and have this affect all instances of the image</li>
			</ul>
</section>
		<h1>Use Cases</h1>
		<p>What use cases does this support?</p>
		<p>There are many use cases that are supported as listed below. There are two primary use cases.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The need for different image sources at different viewport sizes in responsive web designs.</li>
			<li>The need for different image sources depending on the pixel density of the display.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Most of the more specific use cases fall under one of these two umbrella needs.</p>
    
		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Viewport Sizes</h2>
		<p>There are many different screen sizes that are in common daily usage, ranging from small phones to giant high-definition televisions. This change in how we access the web was the main reason for needing to make responsive websites in the first place.</p>
		<p>A common practice in responsive design is delivering images without height and width attributes and letting the browser resize the image. This technique is commonly called flexible images or fluid images.</p>
		<p>However, delivering an image at a size optimized for large displays to a small display is not ideal. Large images incur unnecessary download and processing time, slowing the experience for users.</p>
		<p>To solve this problem, web authors will provide multiple sources of the same image at different resolutions and then pick the correct size image based on the viewport size. This is commonly done for CSS background images in responsive designs, but web authors lack the tools to do so for images in HTML without the use of JavaScript.</p>

		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Display Density</h2>
		<p>Since the high-density devices (e.g., Retina&trade; displays on Apple products) came out, the quality of images on the web has changed. Beforehand, even though we had a variety of device sizes, the DPI has always been the same. This is no longer the case and it is very likely that the current resolution/pixel density on Retina&trade; devices will not be the only one.</p>

		<p>We should be ready and able to support the current resolutions as well as any others that manufacturers may use in the future.</p>

		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Mobile-first and desktop-first responsive design</h2>
		<p>A common approach in sites that cater to a wide range of devices using a single codebase is a “mobile-first” development pattern—starting with a simple, linear layout and increasing layout and functional complexity for larger screen sizes using media queries.</p>

		<p>“Desktop-first” responsive design takes the opposite approach and starts from the desktop design and simplifies it using media queries to support small displays. Authors retrofitting existing sites often take a desktop-first approach out of necessity because changing to a mobile-first approach would be a significant undertaking.</p>
    
		<p>These two approaches require that a solution for images support the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Authors need the ability to define fallback image as the smallest image (mobile first) or the largest image (desktop first).</li>
			<li>Authors would like to define the breakpoints for images as either minimum values (mobile first) or maximum values (desktop first) to match the media queries used in their design.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Relative Units</h2>
		<p>A common practice in creating flexible layouts is to specify the size values in media queries as relative units: <code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>/<code>vh</code> etc. This is most commonly seen using ems in order to reflow layouts based on users’ zoom preferences, or to resize elements through JavaScript by dynamically altering a font-size value.</p>
    
		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Matching image source breakpoints to design breakpoints</h2>
		<p>Web authors would like to be able to optionally match the breakpoints for images to the breakpoints that they have defined in their responsive designs. Being able to match the breakpoints ensures that images are operating under the same rules that define the layout. It also helps authors verify their approach by ensuring that the same viewport measurement tests are being used in both HTML and CSS.</p>
    
		<p>This desire is a facet of the two preceding use cases (mobile/desktop-first responsive design and relative units). If a breakpoint in the design is defined as:</p>
    
		<p><code>@media screen (max-width: 41em) {}</code></p>
    
		<p>Then web authors would like to be able to define a similar breakpoint for images at a max-width of 41em and not have to translate that measurement into another unit like pixels even if it is possible to calculate that measurement:</p>
    
		<ul>
			<li>The default font size in most browsers is 16 pixels. So 41em can be calculated to be 41 * 16 = 656 pixels. Calculating this for every breakpoint, while possible, would be tedious and potentially error-prone for authors.</li>
			<li>Unless the image break points support both max and min values, then the image breakpoint will need to be further modified from the layout breakpoint that it was derived from. For example, if the image format only supports minimum width tests, then instead of using a maximum width of 656 pixels, the document author would need to specify 657 pixels as a minimum width for the breakpoint.</li>
		</ul>
    
		<p>When debugging a document, if the author cannot specify breakpoints for images in the same manner that they are defined for the design, authors will need to convert the breakpoints back to the values specified in the layout in order to verify that they match. This increases authoring time and the likelihood that math errors on the part of authors (possibly due to a different rounding scheme in a particular user agent) cause unexpected behavior.</p>        
            
		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Mobile Networks</h2>
		<p>It should be noted that many devices are used on mobile networks which are often very slow or exhibit high latency. Often times conferences suffer from slow networks as well due to many users attempting to use a single network connection simultaneously. Many people also have very slow or erratic connections in their homes and workplaces. While it may not be possible for a solution to be based on bandwidth, anything that can be done to reduce latency and HTTP requests should be done.</p>

		<p>Allowing authors to specify different images for different viewport sizes and display densities is one step towards providing a better experience on slow networks. In the future, user agents may be able to select different images based on network speed or user preference.</p>
    
		<h2 class="informative-subhed">User Zoom</h2>
		<p>Images blur when the user resizes the page. Users may zoom an image in order to see more detail. In these cases, user agents could select a higher-resolution version of an image to display.</p>
		<div class="issue">It's not clear whether the picture element is prescriptive (i.e. the user agent MUST show a particular image given certain device properties) or suggestive (i.e. the user agent has control over picking the best image).</div>
    
		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Art Direction</h2>
		<p>Web authors often want to provide different versions of the same image at different sizes depending on the viewport. We refer to this as the <dfn>a rt direction</dfn> use case.</p>
		<p>A simple example of this would be changing the crop of an image based on display area:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a website wants to normally show a large image (e.g. of a figure with a broad background) on displays that are big enough.</li>
			<li>when shown on a smaller device, simply shrinking the image may reduce its relevance, usefulness, or legibility, and thus the site may wish to show a different cropping or layout of the same image at the smaller size.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Examples: <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/a-framework-for-discussing-responsive-images-solutions/#artdirection">Large photo of Obama at a Chrysler plant vs. tighter cropped thumbnail</a></p>
		<p>A more complex example that changes orientation of the image, crop, and how text flows around an image based on the size of the viewport:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On the Nokia Browser site where it describes the <a href="http://browser.nokia.com/smartphones.html">Meego browser</a>, the Nokia Lumia is shown <a href="http://browser.nokia.com/resources/images/home-feature.png">horizontally on wide screens</a>. As the screen narrows, the Nokia Lumia is then shown <a href="http://browser.nokia.com/resources/images/smartphones/choose-meego@320.png">vertically and cropped</a>. Bryan and Stephanie Rieger, the designers of the site, have talked about how on a wide screen, showing the full phone horizontally showed the browser best, but on small screens, changing the img to vertical made more sense because it allowed the reader to still make out the features of the browser in the image.</li>
		</ul>
    
		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Alternate Print Sources</h2>
		<p>Printed web documents generally have pixelated images due to printers having a higher DPI than most images currently served on the web. Defining higher resolution images for printing would increase the abilities of web authors to define great printed versions of their documents. For example, a photo sharing site could provide a bandwidth-optimized image for display on screen, but a high-resolution image for print.</p>
    
		<h2 class="informative-subhed">Gray Scale and High Contrast Modes</h2>
